                food. We’re excited to share a taste of the islands with you. Come by our restaurant and escape to the West Indies where you can 
                immerse yourself in the colors and tastes of the islands. Our food is inspired by countries like Barbados, Trinidad, and Guyana.

            <h2 class="about-title">About Us</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Bunjay Curry started because I fell in love with Caribbean food while living in the West Indies. The strong,
                spicy flavors, the heavy use of spices, and the blend of African and Indian influences make Caribbean curries truly unique. They’re 
                unlike anything else — deep, rich, and full of history. After experiencing those flavors firsthand, I wanted to bring that same 
                energy and authenticity back home. Bunjay Curry is my way of sharing the food that inspired me and the culture that shaped it. Try
                our fresh fired egg-balls with mango-sour sauce.
